One bug is that, if examplegc.num_bytes is a number less than zero, the 
program will execute malloc(a number less than 0),such as malloc(-116) in 
line 188.

Another bug is that, the program does not check the bound of the array. In 
line 30, if arg1 is a number bigger than 16, there will be an exception. 

infinite loopï¼š
in case 9, if  pc does not have any change, which means arg1 might be 0,
in the next loop, it will still go to case 9
